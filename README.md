Gradient Descent, Linear Regression, and Regularization
This repository provides implementation of Gradient Descent, Linear Regression and Regularization algorithms using Python. These algorithms are widely used in machine learning and statistical inference. By executing the commands mentioned above, one can run the implementation of these algorithms and analyze their performance.
Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is a popular optimization algorithm that can be used to minimize a given loss function. It is widely used in machine learning and deep learning for finding the optimal weights that minimize the loss function.
Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It is widely used in finance, economics, and social sciences.
Regularization Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which prevents the model from overfitting the training data.
